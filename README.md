SyMaps is an alternative online map which is based on Mapbox GL, an awesome library!
<br>The software can be seen at [syndesi.de/maps](http://syndesi.de/maps).

## Install guide for the React environment

1. Prerequisites: Make sure to use a proper code editor like [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).
2. Install NodeJS from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Make sure to use the latest version.
3. Install Yarn from [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/). It's an alternative dependency management software for NodeJS and used by our software.
4. Go to the repo's react folder, normally under *C:/xampp/htdocs/SyMaps/react/*.
5. Shift-rightclick and select *Open PowerShell here* (Windows 10) or *Open command window here* (< Windows 10).
6. Execute the command `yarn install`.
7. Install the webpack-dev-server globally: `yarn add webpack-dev-server -g`.
8. Execute the command `yarn start`.
9. If everything went properly, then the website should be available under [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) or [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080). <br>
